## Core Papers

### 1. Active Honeypot Guardrail System
**Title:** "Active Honeypot Guardrail System: Probing and Confirming Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreaks"  
**arXiv:** 2510.15017  
**Key Concepts:**
- Proactive defense using bait responses to probe user intent
- Multi-turn jailbreak detection through conversational analysis
- Disrupts jailbreak attempts by inserting strategic questions

**Relevance to This Implementation:**
- Our `JailbreakDetector._detect_multi_turn_pattern()` method is inspired by this approach
- We analyze conversation history to detect gradual escalation patterns
- The circuit breaker can be configured to be more sensitive to multi-turn patterns

### 2. EEG-Defender
**Title:** "EEG-Defender: Defending against Jailbreak through Early Exit Generation of Large Language Models"  
**arXiv:** 2408.11308  
**Key Concepts:**
- Early exit generation to detect malicious inputs
- Terminates generation immediately upon detection
- Uses initial embeddings to identify jailbreak prompts

**Relevance to This Implementation:**
- Our circuit breaker pattern aligns with the "early exit" concept
- When a jailbreak is detected, the circuit opens to prevent further processing
- The detector analyzes inputs before full model processing

### 3. AdaSteer
**Title:** "AdaSteer: Your Aligned LLM is Inherently an Adaptive Jailbreak Defender"  
**arXiv:** 2504.09466  
**Key Concepts:**
- Adaptive activation steering method
- Dynamically adjusts model behavior based on input characteristics
- Robust defense while preserving benign input handling

**Relevance to This Implementation:**
- Our threat level classification (SAFE, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL) allows for adaptive responses
- The circuit breaker can be configured with different thresholds for different threat levels
- Multi-factor scoring system adapts to various attack patterns

### 4. Concept Enhancement Engineering (CEE)
**Title:** "Concept Enhancement Engineering: Enhancing the Safety of Embodied LLMs by Dynamically Steering Internal Activations"  
**arXiv:** 2504.13201  
**Key Concepts:**
- Dynamic steering of internal activations
- Reinforces safe behavior during inference
- Mitigates jailbreak attacks while maintaining task performance

**Relevance to This Implementation:**
- Our detection system uses multiple factors (patterns, keywords, bypass techniques) similar to concept steering
- The circuit breaker reinforces safety by blocking suspicious requests
- The system maintains functionality for safe requests while blocking malicious ones

## Circuit Breaker Pattern

### Traditional Circuit Breaker Pattern
The circuit breaker pattern is a well-established design pattern for fault tolerance:

- **Martin Fowler's Article:** "Circuit Breaker" - Describes the three-state pattern (Closed, Open, Half-Open)
- **Michael T. Nygard's "Release It!"** - Comprehensive guide to production-ready software, including circuit breakers

**Implementation Libraries:**
- **Resilience4j (Java):** Lightweight fault tolerance library
- **Polly (.NET):** Resilience and transient-fault-handling library
- **PyCircuitBreaker (Python):** Python implementation of circuit breaker pattern

## Jailbreak Attack Patterns

### Common Jailbreak Techniques
Our implementation detects various jailbreak patterns documented in research:

1. **Instruction Override:** Attempts to make the model ignore its safety guidelines
2. **Role-Playing:** Asking the model to pretend to be an unrestricted version
3. **Hypothetical Scenarios:** Using hypothetical situations to bypass restrictions
4. **Multi-Turn Escalation:** Gradually escalating requests over multiple turns
5. **Encoding/Obfuscation:** Using encoding or obfuscation to hide malicious intent

### Research on Jailbreak Attacks
- **"Jailbreaking Black Box Large Language Models in Twenty Queries"** - Documents various jailbreak techniques
- **"Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models"** - Shows transferability of attacks
- **"Not What You've Signed Up For: Compromising Real-World LLM-Integrated Applications with Prompt Injection"** - Real-world attack scenarios

## Evaluation Metrics

Our evaluation framework uses standard classification metrics:

- **Precision:** Proportion of blocked requests that were actually jailbreaks
- **Recall:** Proportion of jailbreaks that were successfully blocked
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **False Positive Rate:** Proportion of safe requests incorrectly blocked
- **False Negative Rate:** Proportion of jailbreaks incorrectly allowed

These metrics align with standard practices in security and machine learning evaluation.

## Future Directions

Based on the literature, promising areas for enhancement include:

1. **Early Exit Detection:** Implementing EEG-Defender style early detection using model embeddings
2. **Adaptive Thresholds:** Using AdaSteer-style adaptive thresholds based on input characteristics
3. **Honeypot Integration:** Implementing Active Honeypot style bait responses for multi-turn detection
4. **Representation Engineering:** Using CEE-style activation steering for more sophisticated detection
